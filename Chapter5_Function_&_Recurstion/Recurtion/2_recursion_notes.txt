Important notes:
1. Recursion is sometimes the most direct way to code an algorithm
2. The condition which doesn't call the function any furhter in a recursive function is called as the base condition.
3. Sometimes, due to a mistake made by the progammer a recursive function can keep running withour returing resulting in a memory error.


Recursion is kind of a Loop function. To make progaming easy
